# Lab: 08 - OO Design and GSON:

In this lab I used a json file to generate random popular book quotes. a *Books* class has been created in order to make it matching the required data in the Json file. also, to convert the Array in json file to a **List** of type *Books* in order to make it available to be converted from json.
